Alice found herself very tiny and wandering around Wonderland.
Even the grass around her seemed like a maze.

This is a tiny maze solver.

A maze is represented by a matrix

[[:S 0 1]
 [1  0 1]
 [1  0 :E]]

S : start of the maze
E : end of the maze
1 : This is a wall that you cannot pass through
0 : A free space that you can move through.

The goal is the get to the end of the maze.
A solved maze will have a :x in the start, the path,
and the end of the maze, like this.

[[:x :x 1]
 [1  :x 1]
 [1  :x :x]]
