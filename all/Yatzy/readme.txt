The game of yatzy is a simple dice game. Each player
rolls five six-sided dice. The player places the roll in
a category, such as ones, twos, fives, pair, two pairs
etc (see below).
If the roll is compatible with the category, the player
gets a score for the roll according to the rules. If the
roll is not compatible with the category, the player scores
zero for the roll.

For example, if a player rolls 5,6,5,5,2 and scores the
dice in the fives category they would score 15 (three fives).

Your task is to score a GIVEN roll in a GIVEN category.
You do NOT have to program the random dice rolling.
You do NOT have to program re-rolls (as in the real game).
You do NOT play by letting the computer choose the highest
scoring category for a given roll.
