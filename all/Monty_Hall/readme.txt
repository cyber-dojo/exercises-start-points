Suppose you're on a game show and you're given the
choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind
the others, goats. The car and the goats were
placed randomly behind the doors before the show.

The rules of the game show are as follows:

After you have chosen a door, the door remains closed
for the time being. The game show host, Monty Hall, who
knows what is behind the doors, now has to open one of
the two remaining doors, and the door he opens must have
a goat behind it. If both remaining doors have goats
behind them, he chooses one randomly. After Monty Hall
opens a door with a goat, he will ask you to decide
whether you want to stay with your first choice or to
switch to the last remaining door.

For example:
Imagine that you chose Door 1 and the host opens Door 3,
which has a goat. He then asks you "Do you want to switch
to Door Number 2?" Is it to your advantage to change your
choice?

Note that the player may initially choose any of the
three doors (not just Door 1), that the host opens a
different door revealing a goat (not necessarily Door 3),
and that he gives the player a second choice between the
two remaining unopened doors.

Simulate at least a thousand games using three doors for
each strategy and show the results in such a way as to make
it easy to compare the effects of each strategy.
