Given a string, strip all occurences of consecutively 
occuring backslash and newline characters. For example, 
assuming that:
"\\" represents '\' and 
"\n" represents '\n'

  "ab\\\ncd\\\nef" --> "abcdef" (two stripped out)

  "abc\\\ndef"     --> "abcdef" (one stripped out)

  "abc\n\\def"     --> unchanged (wrong order)

  "abc\\def"       --> unchanged (no \n)

  "abc\ndef"       --> unchanged (no \)

  "abcdef"         --> unchanged
