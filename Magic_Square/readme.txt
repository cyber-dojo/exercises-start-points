This puzzle comes from Lewis Carroll.
The magic part is when the values on a square are arranged
so that adding them up in any direction results in a constant sum.

You have the following values:

1.0
1.5
2.0
2.5
3.0
3.5
4.0
4.5
5.0

You need to arrange them in a 3 x 3 matrix so that:

The sums of numbers in each row = magic number
The sums of numbers in each column = magic number
The sums of numbers in each diagonal = magic number
