The game of yatzy is a simple dice game. Each player
rolls five six-sided dice. The player places the roll in
a category, such as one-pair, two-pair, small-straight etc
(see below).
If the roll is compatible with the category, the player
gets a score for the roll according to the rules. If the
roll is not compatible with the category, the player scores
zero for the roll.

For example, if a player rolls 5,6,5,6,2 and scores the
dice in the two-pairs category they would score 22 (5+5+6+6).

Your task is to score a GIVEN roll in a GIVEN category.
You do NOT have to program the random dice rolling.
You do NOT have to program re-rolls (as in the real game).
You do NOT play by letting the computer choose the highest
scoring category for a given roll.


Yatzy Categories and Scoring Rules
==================================

Yatzy:
  If all dice have the same number,
  the player scores 50 points, otherwise 0.
  For example,
   1,1,1,1,1 placed on "yatzy" scores 50
   5,5,5,5,5 placed on "yatzy" scores 50
   1,1,1,2,1 placed on "yatzy" scores 0

Pair:
  If exactly two dice have the same value then
  the player scores the sum of the two highest matching dice.
  For example, when placed on "pair"
   3,3,3,4,4 scores 8 (4+4)
   1,1,6,2,6 scores 12 (6+6)
   3,3,3,4,1 scores 0
   3,3,3,3,1 scores 0

Two pairs:
  If exactly two dice have the same value and exactly
  two dice have a different value then the

   1,1,2,3,4 scores 0
   1,1,2,2,2 scores 0

Three of a kind:

    3,3,4,5,6 scores 0
    3,3,3,3,1 scores 0
