You task is to find the longest common prefix from a set of strings.
There are two variations:

Variation 1.
Find the longest common prefix across ALL strings in the set.
For example:

     { "new", "next" } ==> "ne"
     
     { "newest", "new", "newly" } ==> "new"
          
     { "pond", "pod", "new", "newest" } ==> ""
     
     
Variation 2.
Find the longest common prefix across ANY two or more strings in the set.
For example:

     { "pond", "newest" } ==> ""

     { "new", "night" } ==> "n"
     
     { "newest", "new", "newly" } ==> "new"
     
     { "pond", "pod", "new", "newest" } ==> "new"
