You task is to find the length of the longest common prefix from a set of strings.
There are two variations:

Variation 1.
Find the length of longest common prefix across ALL strings in the set.
For example:

     { "new", "next" } ==> 2
     
     { "newest", "new", "newly" } ==> 3
          
     { "pond", "pod", "new", "newest" } ==> 0
     
     
Variation 2.
Find the length of longest common prefix across ANY two or more strings in the set.
For example:

     { "pond", "newest" } ==> 0

     { "new", "night" } ==> 1
     
     { "newest", "new", "newly" } ==> 3

     { "pond", "pod", "new", "newest" } ==> 3
