Given a list of phone numbers, determine if it is 
consistent. In a consistent phone list no number 
is a prefix of another. For example:

    o) Bob 91 12 54 26
    o) Alice 97 625 992
    o) Emergency 911

In this case, it is not possible to call Bob because 
the phone exchange would direct your call to the 
emergency line as soon as you dialled the first three 
digits of Bob's phone number. So this list would not 
be consistent.
