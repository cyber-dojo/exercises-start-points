Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0's and 1's.
How many n-digit binary numbers are there that
don't have two adjacent 1 bits?

For example, for three-digit numbers, Five of the
possible eight combinations meet the criteria:

   000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.

What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?

Having worked out the pattern, there's a second part to
the question: can you prove why that relationship exists?
