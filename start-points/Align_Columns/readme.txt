Given a text file of many lines, where fields within a line are delineated by a single 'dollar' character, write a program that aligns each column of fields by ensuring that words in each column are separated by at least one space.

For Example:

Given$a$text$file$of$many$lines,$where$fields$within$a$line$
are$delineated$by$a$single$'dollar'$character,$write$a$program
that$aligns$each$column$of$fields$by$ensuring$that$words$in$each$
column$are$separated$by$at$least$one$space.

Notes:
- The example input texts lines may, or may not, have trailing dollar characters.
- Lines may, or may not, contain the same number of fields.
- All columns should share the same alignment.
- Consecutive space characters produced adjacent to the end of lines are insignificant for the purposes of the task.
- Assume output text will be viewed in a mono-spaced font on a plain text editor or basic terminal.
- The minimum space between columns should be computed from the text and not hard-coded.
