Task
Problem: you have a standard 8x8 chessboard, empty but for a single knight on some square. Your task is to emit a series of legal knight moves that result in the knight visiting every square on the chessboard exactly once. Note that it is not a requirement that the tour be "closed"; that is, the knight need not end within a single move of its start position.

Input: starting square
Output: move sequence

All input/output is to use Algebraic Notation.
