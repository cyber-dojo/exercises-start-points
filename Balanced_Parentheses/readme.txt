Write a program to determine if the the parentheses (),
the brackets [], and the braces {}, in a string are balanced.

For example:

{{)(}} is not balanced because ) comes before (

({)} is not balanced because ) is not balanced between {}
     and similarly the { is not balanced between ()

[({})] is balanced

{}([]) is balanced

{()}[[{}]] is balanced
